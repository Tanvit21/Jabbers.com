From one mobile phone number, one can register 4 people, however, each person will need their own photo identification document.

If Aadhar card is used as identification document, consent will be obtained and recorded.

Through the portal, you can find out the list of available CVCs and dates and time of available vaccination slots, to book an appointment as per your choice. You will need an OTP verification prior to registration and a confirmation slip/token will be generated after registration. You will also get a confirmatory sms later.

For all Private Hospitals, prior registration and appointment will be the only method of registration.

For Government hospitals, a proportion of slots will be available for online registration and appointment, the rest will be kept for on site registration and vaccination.
